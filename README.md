# Predictive-Maintainence For Industrial Equipment
Description:
This repository contains the code and resources for a predictive maintenance project aimed at forecasting equipment failures in industrial settings. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze historical equipment data and predict potential failures before they occur, helping to minimize downtime and maintenance costs. The code includes data preprocessing, model development using XGBoost, hyperparameter tuning, and the development of a Streamlit web application for visualization and interaction with the predictive models.

Key Features:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning, feature engineering, and label encoding.
Machine learning model development using XGBoost algorithm.
Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation techniques.
Streamlit web application for real-time visualization and interaction with predictive models.
Technologies Used:
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project contains historical data on equipment performance, including air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, tool wear, and failure types.
